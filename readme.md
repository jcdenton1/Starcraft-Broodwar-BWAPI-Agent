Starcraft Broodwar BWAPI agent using A* & custom heuristic.

We had to be modest about our goals due to time limitation.
We decided to focus on the following elements in the game:
	*Resource collection
	*Searching unknown places in the map
	*Finding new resource fields in the map
	*Expanding to new key spots on the map
